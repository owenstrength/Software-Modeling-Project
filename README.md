# Introduction

Your customer needs a word processor app, similar to Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, or Pages. The system must allow the creation of multiple documents for editing and viewing side-by-side. Documents consist of pages (with or without page numbers), and pages can contain a mix of text, tables, pictures, and figures. The user should be able to change the color of the text, modify the background color, or use pictures as a background. Additionally, the system should support changing the font and size of the text and also the color and style of tables. Users should have the capability to save and load the documents they create. Lastly, the system should prevent loss of data and it should be cross-platform, i.e., it should run on various operating systems.
